# CuckooGUI
##Overview
This repository contains the simulation framework for modeling hostâ€“parasite coevolution, with a focus on brood parasitism dynamics between cuckoos and reedbirds. The model is a stochastic reinforcement model, capturing both population-level dynamics and behavioral adaptation under varying ecological scenarios. It allows for long-term simulations with user-defined inputs, enabling exploration of evolutionary strategies and survival outcomes.
